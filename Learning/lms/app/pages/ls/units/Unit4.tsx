              <h3>Language Meets Society!</h3>
              <p>Have you ever noticed that you speak differently with your friends than with your professors? Or that people from different regions have different accents? That's sociolinguistics in action!</p>
              
              <p>Sociolinguistics studies the fascinating relationship between language and society - how social factors like age, gender, class, and region influence the way we speak.</p>

              <h4>What is Sociolinguistics?</h4>
              <p>Sociolinguistics examines how language varies and changes in social contexts. It answers questions like:</p>
              
              <ul>
                <li>Why do people from different regions speak differently?</li>
                <li>How does your social class affect your language?</li>
                <li>Why do men and women sometimes use language differently?</li>
                <li>How do bilingual speakers switch between languages?</li>
                <li>What makes a language "standard" or "non-standard"?</li>
              </ul>

              <h4>Language Variation - Why We All Speak Differently</h4>
              
              <h5>Types of Language Variation</h5>
              
              <div className="example-box">
                <h5>1. Regional Variation (Dialects)</h5>
                <p>Different geographic areas have different ways of speaking:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li><strong>American English:</strong> "I'm gonna go to the store"</li>
                  <li><strong>British English:</strong> "I'm going to the shop"</li>
                  <li><strong>Indian English:</strong> "I'm going to the shop only"</li>
                  <li><strong>Same language, different flavors!</strong></li>
                </ul>
              </div>

              <div className="example-box">
                <h5>2. Social Variation (Sociolects)</h5>
                <p>Your social group affects how you speak:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li><strong>Working class:</strong> Might use more vernacular forms</li>
                  <li><strong>Upper class:</strong> Might use more standard forms</li>
                  <li><strong>Youth:</strong> Use current slang ("That's fire!", "No cap")</li>
                  <li><strong>Older generation:</strong> Use older expressions ("That's groovy!")</li>
                </ul>
              </div>

              <div className="example-box">
                <h5>3. Stylistic Variation (Registers)</h5>
                <p>You change your language based on the situation:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li><strong>Formal (job interview):</strong> "I would be delighted to join your organization"</li>
                  <li><strong>Casual (friends):</strong> "Yeah, I'd love to work there!"</li>
                  <li><strong>Intimate (family):</strong> "Gonna take that job!"</li>
                </ul>
              </div>

              <h4>Social Factors Affecting Language</h4>
              
              <h5>1. Geographic Region</h5>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Accent:</strong> How you pronounce words</li>
                <li><strong>Vocabulary:</strong> "Soda" vs "pop" vs "coke" (all mean soft drink!)</li>
                <li><strong>Grammar:</strong> "You guys" vs "Y'all" vs "Yinz"</li>
              </ul>

              <h5>2. Social Class</h5>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Pronunciation:</strong> Dropping 'h' sounds, 'g' in -ing</li>
                <li><strong>Vocabulary:</strong> Formal vs informal words</li>
                <li><strong>Grammar:</strong> "I don't have any" vs "I ain't got none"</li>
                <li><strong>Both are systematic, neither is "wrong"!</strong></li>
              </ul>

              <h5>3. Age</h5>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Teenagers:</strong> Create and use new slang constantly</li>
                <li><strong>Adults:</strong> More conservative language use</li>
                <li><strong>Elderly:</strong> May use older forms that sound "outdated"</li>
                <li><strong>Example:</strong> "Cool" (1950s) → "Rad" (1980s) → "Lit" (2010s) → "Fire" (2020s)</li>
              </ul>

              <h5>4. Gender</h5>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Stereotypes exist:</strong> But individual variation is huge!</li>
                <li><strong>Research shows:</strong> Women often use more standard forms in formal contexts</li>
                <li><strong>Men might:</strong> Use more vernacular forms to show solidarity</li>
                <li><strong>Important:</strong> These are tendencies, not rules!</li>
              </ul>

              <h5>5. Ethnicity</h5>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Ethnic dialects:</strong> African American Vernacular English (AAVE), Chicano English</li>
                <li><strong>Systematic grammar:</strong> Not "broken" English, but rule-governed varieties</li>
                <li><strong>Identity marker:</strong> Shows group membership and pride</li>
              </ul>

              <h4>Speech Communities</h4>
              <p>A speech community is a group of people who share linguistic norms and rules for using language.</p>
              
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Not just location:</strong> Can be based on profession, hobby, identity</li>
                <li><strong>Examples:</strong> Doctors, gamers, skaters, lawyers</li>
                <li><strong>Shared norms:</strong> How to speak, what's appropriate, special vocabulary</li>
                <li><strong>Membership:</strong> Shown through language use</li>
              </ul>

              <h4>Standard vs. Non-Standard Language</h4>
              
              <h5>Standard Language</h5>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>What it is:</strong> The variety considered "correct" or "proper"</li>
                <li><strong>Used in:</strong> Education, government, media, formal writing</li>
                <li><strong>Has prestige:</strong> Associated with power and education</li>
                <li><strong>Important:</strong> It's a social construct, not linguistically superior!</li>
              </ul>

              <h5>Non-Standard/Vernacular Varieties</h5>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>What they are:</strong> Regional or social dialects</li>
                <li><strong>Equally complex:</strong> Have systematic grammar rules</li>
                <li><strong>Stigmatized:</strong> Often unfairly considered "incorrect"</li>
                <li><strong>Identity:</strong> Important for community and cultural identity</li>
              </ul>

              <h4>Code-Switching - Language Gymnastics!</h4>
              <p>Code-switching is alternating between different languages or varieties in a single conversation.</p>
              
              <div className="example-box">
                <h5>Examples of Code-Switching</h5>
                <ul>
                  <li><strong>Spanish-English:</strong> "Voy a ir al store porque necesito milk" (I'm going to the store because I need milk)</li>
                  <li><strong>Formal-Informal:</strong> "The meeting was productive [formal], but man, it was boring [informal]"</li>
                  <li><strong>Standard-Dialect:</strong> Switching between standard English and AAVE</li>
                </ul>
              </div>

              <h5>Why Do People Code-Switch?</h5>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Fill lexical gaps:</strong> Word exists in one language but not the other</li>
                <li><strong>Express identity:</strong> Show membership in multiple communities</li>
                <li><strong>Emphasize a point:</strong> Switch for dramatic effect</li>
                <li><strong>Accommodate audience:</strong> Match the language of your listener</li>
                <li><strong>Quote someone:</strong> Use their language/dialect</li>
              </ul>

              <h5>Code-Switching vs. Code-Mixing</h5>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Code-switching:</strong> Alternating between sentences or clauses</li>
                <li><strong>Code-mixing:</strong> Mixing within a single sentence or phrase</li>
                <li><strong>Both are skilled:</strong> Require knowledge of both codes!</li>
              </ul>

              <h4>Language Attitudes and Ideologies</h4>
              <p>People have strong feelings about language!</p>
              
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Prescriptivism:</strong> "There's only one correct way to speak"</li>
                <li><strong>Descriptivism:</strong> "All varieties are valid; let's describe how people actually speak"</li>
                <li><strong>Language prejudice:</strong> Judging people by how they speak</li>
                <li><strong>Linguistic discrimination:</strong> Denying opportunities based on language variety</li>
              </ul>

              <div className="example-box">
                <h5>Try It Yourself!</h5>
                <p>Observe your own language variation:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>How do you speak differently with friends vs. professors?</li>
                  <li>What slang do you use that your parents don't understand?</li>
                  <li>Do you code-switch? When and why?</li>
                  <li>What accent or dialect features do you have from your region?</li>

              <div className="example-box">
                <h5>1. Status Planning</h5>
                <ul>
                  <li><strong>Official language:</strong> Making a language official (e.g., Hindi and English in India)</li>
                  <li><strong>National language:</strong> Symbol of national identity</li>
                  <li><strong>Example:</strong> After independence, many African countries chose between colonial and indigenous languages</li>
                </ul>

                <ul>
                  <li><strong>Standardization:</strong> Creating standard spelling, grammar</li>
                  <li><strong>Modernization:</strong> Creating new words for modern concepts</li>
                  <li><strong>Example:</strong> Hebrew was revived and modernized for modern Israel</li>
