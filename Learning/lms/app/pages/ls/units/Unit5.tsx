              <h3>Language: The Mirror of Culture</h3>
              <p>Ever wondered why some languages have dozens of words for snow, while others have just one? Or why certain concepts exist in one language but not another? Welcome to the fascinating world of language and culture!</p>
              
              <p>Language and culture are inseparable - language reflects cultural values, transmits cultural knowledge, and even shapes how we think about the world.</p>

              <h4>Understanding Language-Culture Relationships</h4>
              <p>Language and culture are intimately connected in multiple ways:</p>
              
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Language as cultural vehicle:</strong> Transmits cultural knowledge across generations</li>
                <li><strong>Culture shapes language:</strong> Cultural needs create linguistic structures</li>
                <li><strong>Language shapes thought:</strong> May influence how we perceive reality</li>
                <li><strong>Identity marker:</strong> Language signals cultural membership</li>
              </ul>

              <h4>Cultural Aspects of Language</h4>
              
              <h5>1. Language as Cultural Transmission</h5>
              <div className="example-box">
                <p>Language is the primary way cultures pass down knowledge, values, and traditions:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li><strong>Oral traditions:</strong> Stories, myths, legends passed through generations</li>
                  <li><strong>Proverbs:</strong> "A stitch in time saves nine" (English - value of prevention)</li>
                  <li><strong>Idioms:</strong> "It's raining cats and dogs" (cultural-specific expressions)</li>
                  <li><strong>Rituals:</strong> Wedding vows, religious ceremonies use special language</li>
                </ul>
              </div>

              <h5>2. Worldview and Linguistic Relativity</h5>
              <p>Does the language you speak affect how you think? This is the core question of linguistic relativity!</p>
              
              <div className="example-box">
                <h5>The Sapir-Whorf Hypothesis</h5>
                <p>Proposed by Edward Sapir and Benjamin Lee Whorf, this hypothesis has two versions:</p>
                
                <h6>Strong Version (Linguistic Determinism)</h6>
                <ul>
                  <li><strong>Claim:</strong> Language determines thought completely</li>
                  <li><strong>Example:</strong> If your language has no word for "blue," you can't perceive blue</li>
                  <li><strong>Status:</strong> Largely rejected - too extreme</li>
                </ul>

                <h6>Weak Version (Linguistic Relativity)</h6>
                <ul>
                  <li><strong>Claim:</strong> Language influences thought and perception</li>
                  <li><strong>Example:</strong> Your language affects how easily you think about certain concepts</li>
                  <li><strong>Status:</strong> Supported by research - more accepted</li>
                </ul>
              </div>

              <h5>Evidence for Linguistic Relativity</h5>
              
              <div className="example-box">
                <h6>Color Perception Studies</h6>
                <ul>
                  <li><strong>Russian:</strong> Has separate words for light blue (goluboy) and dark blue (siniy)</li>
                  <li><strong>Finding:</strong> Russian speakers distinguish these shades faster than English speakers</li>
                  <li><strong>Implication:</strong> Language categories affect perception speed</li>
                </ul>
              </div>

              <div className="example-box">
                <h6>Spatial Concepts</h6>
                <ul>
                  <li><strong>English:</strong> Uses egocentric terms (left, right, front, back)</li>
                  <li><strong>Guugu Yimithirr (Australian):</strong> Uses cardinal directions (north, south, east, west)</li>
                  <li><strong>Example:</strong> "The cup is north of the plate" instead of "to the left of"</li>
                  <li><strong>Result:</strong> Guugu Yimithirr speakers have exceptional orientation skills</li>
                </ul>
              </div>

              <div className="example-box">
                <h6>Time Concepts</h6>
                <ul>
                  <li><strong>English:</strong> Time flows horizontally (past behind, future ahead)</li>
                  <li><strong>Mandarin:</strong> Also uses vertical metaphors (past above, future below)</li>
                  <li><strong>Aymara (Andes):</strong> Past is in front (visible), future behind (unknown)</li>
                  <li><strong>Impact:</strong> Affects how speakers gesture and think about time</li>
                </ul>
              </div>

              <h5>3. Cultural Values Embedded in Language</h5>
              
              <div className="example-box">
                <h6>Lexical Specialization</h6>
                <p>Cultures develop rich vocabulary for important concepts:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li><strong>Arabic:</strong> Hundreds of words for camels (cultural importance)</li>
                  <li><strong>Inuit:</strong> Multiple words for snow types (environmental necessity)</li>
                  <li><strong>English:</strong> Extensive technology vocabulary (cultural focus)</li>
                  <li><strong>Sanskrit:</strong> Rich philosophical and spiritual terminology</li>
                </ul>
              </div>

              <div className="example-box">
                <h6>Grammatical Encoding</h6>
                <p>Grammar can reflect cultural priorities:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li><strong>Japanese:</strong> Complex honorific system (respect hierarchy)</li>
                  <li><strong>Korean:</strong> Seven levels of politeness (social relationships)</li>
                  <li><strong>Turkish:</strong> Evidentiality markers (source of information)</li>
                  <li><strong>Hopi:</strong> No tense system like English (different time concept)</li>
                </ul>
              </div>

              <h5>4. Taboo and Euphemistic Expressions</h5>
              <p>Every culture has topics that are avoided or discussed indirectly:</p>
              
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Death:</strong> "Passed away," "departed," "no longer with us"</li>
                <li><strong>Body functions:</strong> "Restroom," "powder room" instead of "toilet"</li>
                <li><strong>Sex:</strong> Various euphemisms across cultures</li>
                <li><strong>Money:</strong> Some cultures avoid direct discussion</li>
                <li><strong>Names:</strong> Some cultures avoid saying names of deceased</li>
              </ul>

              <h5>5. Ritual and Ceremonial Language</h5>
              <div className="example-box">
                <ul>
                  <li><strong>Religious:</strong> Latin in Catholic mass, Sanskrit in Hindu rituals</li>
                  <li><strong>Legal:</strong> "Objection, Your Honor!" - formal courtroom language</li>
                  <li><strong>Weddings:</strong> "I do" - performative speech acts</li>
                  <li><strong>Greetings:</strong> "Namaste" (India), "Salaam" (Arabic) - cultural meaning</li>
                </ul>
              </div>

              <h4>Linguistic Aspects of Culture</h4>

              <h5>Discourse Patterns Reflecting Cultural Norms</h5>
              <div className="example-box">
                <ul>
                  <li><strong>Direct vs. Indirect:</strong> Western cultures more direct, Asian cultures more indirect</li>
                  <li><strong>Turn-taking:</strong> Some cultures allow overlap, others require silence</li>
                  <li><strong>Storytelling:</strong> Linear (Western) vs. circular (Native American)</li>
                  <li><strong>Argumentation:</strong> Confrontational (US) vs. harmony-seeking (Japan)</li>
                </ul>
              </div>

              <h5>Politeness Systems and Cultural Values</h5>
              <p>Politeness varies dramatically across cultures:</p>
              
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Positive politeness:</strong> Emphasizing closeness (solidarity)</li>
                <li><strong>Negative politeness:</strong> Respecting distance (deference)</li>
                <li><strong>Japanese:</strong> Elaborate honorific system</li>
                <li><strong>English:</strong> "Please," "thank you," indirect requests</li>
                <li><strong>German:</strong> Formal "Sie" vs. informal "du"</li>
              </ul>

              <h5>Language and Cultural Identity</h5>
              <div className="example-box">
                <ul>
                  <li><strong>Heritage language:</strong> Connects to ancestral culture</li>
                  <li><strong>Language loss:</strong> Can mean cultural identity loss</li>
                  <li><strong>Language revival:</strong> Hebrew, Māori, Welsh - reclaiming identity</li>
                  <li><strong>Code-switching:</strong> Navigating multiple cultural identities</li>
                </ul>
              </div>

              <h4>Other Theoretical Approaches</h4>

              <h5>Anthropological Linguistics</h5>
              <ul>

              <h4>Understanding Language-Gender Relationships</h4>
              <p>The relationship between language and gender involves:</p>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Biological sex:</strong> Male, female, intersex</li>
                <li><strong>Social gender:</strong> Masculine, feminine, non-binary identities</li>
                <li><strong>Gender roles:</strong> Culturally expected behaviors</li>
                <li><strong>Gender expression:</strong> How gender is performed through language</li>
              </ul>

              <h4>Gender Differences in Language Use</h4>

              <h5>1. Vocabulary and Lexical Choices</h5>
              <div className="example-box">
                <p>Research has found some tendencies (but remember: these are generalizations, not rules!):</p>
                <ul>
                  <li><strong>Color terms:</strong> Women may use more specific color words (mauve, teal)</li>
                  <li><strong>Intensifiers:</strong> Women: "so beautiful," Men: "really cool"</li>
                  <li><strong>Adjectives:</strong> Women may use more evaluative adjectives (lovely, adorable)</li>
                  <li><strong>Swearing:</strong> Historically more associated with men, but changing</li>
                </ul>
              </div>

              <h5>2. Speech Patterns and Prosody</h5>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Pitch:</strong> Women typically have higher pitch (biological), but range varies culturally</li>
                <li><strong>Intonation:</strong> Women may use more varied intonation patterns</li>
                <li><strong>Tag questions:</strong> "It's nice, isn't it?" - once thought more feminine</li>
                <li><strong>Hedges:</strong> "I think," "maybe," "sort of" - politeness strategies</li>
              </ul>

              <h5>3. Conversational Styles</h5>
              
              <div className="example-box">
                <h6>Deborah Tannen's Research</h6>
                <p>Linguist Deborah Tannen identified different conversational styles:</p>
                
                <ul>
                  <li><strong>Women's style (rapport-talk):</strong>
                    <ul>
                      <li>Focus on building connections</li>
                      <li>Collaborative conversation</li>
                      <li>Supportive responses</li>
                      <li>Sharing experiences</li>
                    </ul>
                  </li>
                  <li><strong>Men's style (report-talk):</strong>
                    <ul>
                      <li>Focus on information exchange</li>
                      <li>Competitive conversation</li>
                      <li>Problem-solving oriented</li>
                      <li>Establishing status</li>
                    </ul>
                  </li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Important:</strong> These are tendencies, not absolutes! Individual variation is huge.</p>
              </div>

              <h5>4. Interrupting and Overlapping</h5>
              <div className="example-box">
                <ul>
                  <li><strong>Research finding:</strong> Men tend to interrupt women more in mixed-gender conversations</li>
                  <li><strong>Power dynamic:</strong> Interruption can signal dominance</li>
                  <li><strong>Cooperative overlap:</strong> Women may overlap to show support</li>
                  <li><strong>Context matters:</strong> Professional vs. casual settings differ</li>
                </ul>
              </div>

              <h5>5. Topic Preferences</h5>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Stereotypical view:</strong> Women talk about people, men about things</li>
                <li><strong>Reality:</strong> Topics vary by context, interest, and individual</li>
                <li><strong>Research shows:</strong> Both genders discuss wide range of topics</li>
                <li><strong>Myth busted:</strong> Women don't talk more than men overall!</li>
              </ul>

              <h4>Gender Construction Through Language</h4>

              <h5>1. Performative Aspects of Gender</h5>
              <p>Judith Butler's theory: Gender is not something you are, but something you do!</p>
              
              <div className="example-box">
                <ul>
                  <li><strong>Gender performance:</strong> We "do" gender through repeated actions, including language</li>
                  <li><strong>Not fixed:</strong> Gender identity is fluid and constructed</li>
                  <li><strong>Language role:</strong> Speech is a key way we perform gender</li>
                  <li><strong>Example:</strong> Using "masculine" or "feminine" speech styles</li>
                </ul>
              </div>

              <h5>2. Indexicality of Gender Markers</h5>
              <p>Certain linguistic features index (signal) gender:</p>
              
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Phonetic features:</strong> Pitch, voice quality</li>
                <li><strong>Lexical choices:</strong> Word selection</li>
                <li><strong>Grammatical forms:</strong> In some languages, verb endings differ by speaker gender</li>
                <li><strong>Discourse patterns:</strong> Conversational style</li>
              </ul>

              <div className="example-box">
                <h6>Japanese Gender Markers</h6>
                <ul>
                  <li><strong>Women:</strong> Use "atashi" (I), sentence-final "wa," "no"</li>
                  <li><strong>Men:</strong> Use "ore" or "boku" (I), sentence-final "zo," "ze"</li>
                  <li><strong>Changing:</strong> Younger generations mixing these markers</li>
                </ul>
              </div>

              <h5>3. Gendered Speech Acts</h5>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Compliments:</strong> Women give and receive more compliments</li>
                <li><strong>Apologies:</strong> Women may apologize more (politeness strategy)</li>
                <li><strong>Directives:</strong> Men may use more direct commands</li>
                <li><strong>Requests:</strong> Women may use more indirect forms</li>
              </ul>

              <h5>4. Gender Identity Expression</h5>
              <div className="example-box">
                <ul>
                  <li><strong>Transgender individuals:</strong> May adopt speech patterns of identified gender</li>
                  <li><strong>Voice training:</strong> Changing pitch, resonance, intonation</li>
                  <li><strong>Lexical choices:</strong> Adopting gendered vocabulary</li>
                  <li><strong>Identity affirmation:</strong> Language as tool for gender expression</li>
                </ul>
              </div>

              <h5>5. Challenging Gender Norms</h5>
              <p>Language can reinforce or challenge gender stereotypes:</p>
              
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Gender-neutral language:</strong> "Firefighter" not "fireman"</li>
                <li><strong>Singular "they":</strong> Gender-neutral pronoun</li>
                <li><strong>Ms.:</strong> Title not indicating marital status</li>
                <li><strong>Challenging binaries:</strong> Recognizing non-binary identities</li>
              </ul>

              <h5>6. Non-Binary Language Use</h5>
              <div className="example-box">
                <ul>
                  <li><strong>Pronouns:</strong> They/them, ze/zir, xe/xem</li>
                  <li><strong>Titles:</strong> Mx. instead of Mr./Ms.</li>
                  <li><strong>Terms:</strong> "Sibling" instead of brother/sister</li>
                  <li><strong>Challenge:</strong> Many languages have grammatical gender</li>
                </ul>
              </div>

              <h4>Sexism in Language</h4>

              <h5>Generic Masculine</h5>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Problem:</strong> Using "he" or "man" to refer to all people</li>
                <li><strong>Example:</strong> "Each student should bring his book"</li>
                <li><strong>Solution:</strong> "Each student should bring their book"</li>
                <li><strong>Impact:</strong> Generic masculine makes women less visible</li>
              </ul>

              <h5>Semantic Derogation</h5>
              <div className="example-box">
                <ul>
                  <li><strong>Pattern:</strong> Female terms acquire negative meanings</li>
                  <li><strong>Examples:</strong>
                    <ul>
                      <li>"Master" vs. "Mistress" (neutral vs. negative)</li>
                      <li>"Bachelor" vs. "Spinster" (positive vs. negative)</li>
                      <li>"Sir" vs. "Madam" (respect vs. brothel keeper)</li>
                    </ul>
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </div>

              <h5>Marked vs. Unmarked Terms</h5>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Unmarked (default):</strong> Doctor, poet, actor</li>
                <li><strong>Marked (specified):</strong> Female doctor, poetess, actress</li>
                <li><strong>Problem:</strong> Implies male is the norm</li>
                <li><strong>Change:</strong> Moving toward gender-neutral terms</li>
              </ul>

              <h4>Language Reform and Gender</h4>

              <div className="example-box">
                <h5>Strategies for Gender-Inclusive Language</h5>
                <ul>

                  <li><strong>Eliminate pronoun:</strong> "The student should bring a book"</li>
                  <li><strong>Use "they":</strong> Singular they is now widely accepted</li>
                  <li><strong>Alternate pronouns:</strong> Use he and she alternately</li>
                  <li><strong>Gender-neutral terms:</strong> Chair (not chairman), server (not waitress)</li>

              <h4>Understanding Language-Power Relationships</h4>
              <p>Language and power are intrinsically linked. Those with institutional power often control language policies and practices, while language can also be a tool of resistance and empowerment.</p>

              <h4>Power in Language</h4>

              <h5>1. Discourse and Dominance</h5>
              <div className="example-box">
                <p>Powerful groups use discourse to maintain and legitimize their dominance:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li><strong>Political discourse:</strong> Framing issues to favor certain viewpoints</li>
                  <li><strong>Media discourse:</strong> Controlling narratives and representations</li>
                  <li><strong>Institutional discourse:</strong> Legal, medical, educational language excludes outsiders</li>
                  <li><strong>Example:</strong> "Illegal immigrant" vs. "Undocumented worker" - different framings</li>
                </ul>
              </div>

              <h5>2. Language Ideology</h5>
              <p>Beliefs and attitudes about language varieties and their speakers:</p>
              
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Standard language ideology:</strong> Belief that one variety is inherently better</li>
                <li><strong>Linguistic prejudice:</strong> Judging people by their language variety</li>
                <li><strong>Accent discrimination:</strong> Denying opportunities based on accent</li>
                <li><strong>Reality:</strong> All varieties are linguistically equal; prestige is social, not linguistic</li>
              </ul>

              <div className="example-box">
                <h6>Standard Language Myths</h6>
                <ul>
                  <li><strong>Myth 1:</strong> Standard language is more logical or correct</li>
                  <li><strong>Reality:</strong> All varieties have systematic grammar</li>
                  <li><strong>Myth 2:</strong> Non-standard varieties are corrupted versions</li>
                  <li><strong>Reality:</strong> They evolved naturally with their own rules</li>
                  <li><strong>Myth 3:</strong> Everyone should speak the standard</li>
                  <li><strong>Reality:</strong> Linguistic diversity is natural and valuable</li>
                </ul>
              </div>

              <h5>3. Gatekeeping and Access</h5>
              <p>Language requirements control access to opportunities:</p>
              
              <div className="example-box">
                <ul>
                  <li><strong>Education:</strong> Standard language required for academic success</li>
                  <li><strong>Employment:</strong> "Professional" language expected in workplace</li>
                  <li><strong>Legal system:</strong> Complex legal language excludes non-experts</li>
                  <li><strong>Healthcare:</strong> Medical jargon creates barriers</li>
                  <li><strong>Result:</strong> Language becomes a tool of social stratification</li>
                </ul>
              </div>

              <h5>4. Language Policy as Power</h5>
              <p>Governments use language policy to exercise power:</p>
              
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Official language laws:</strong> Privilege certain languages</li>
                <li><strong>Education policy:</strong> Which languages taught in schools</li>
                <li><strong>Linguistic imperialism:</strong> Imposing dominant language on minorities</li>
                <li><strong>Language suppression:</strong> Historical bans on minority languages</li>
              </ul>

              <div className="example-box">
                <h6>Historical Examples</h6>
                <ul>
                  <li><strong>Ireland:</strong> English imposed, Irish suppressed under British rule</li>
                  <li><strong>Native Americans:</strong> Forced to speak English in boarding schools</li>
                  <li><strong>France:</strong> Regional languages suppressed to promote French unity</li>
                  <li><strong>Soviet Union:</strong> Russian imposed on minority populations</li>
                </ul>
              </div>

              <h5>5. Media and Language Control</h5>
              <div className="example-box">
                <ul>
                  <li><strong>Representation:</strong> Who gets to speak in media?</li>
                  <li><strong>Framing:</strong> How issues are presented linguistically</li>
                  <li><strong>Silencing:</strong> Whose voices are excluded?</li>
                  <li><strong>Standardization:</strong> Media promotes standard varieties</li>
                  <li><strong>Example:</strong> News anchors speak standard English, reinforcing its prestige</li>
                </ul>
              </div>

              <h4>Language as Resistance</h4>

              <h5>1. Counter-Discourse</h5>
              <p>Challenging dominant narratives through alternative language use:</p>
              
              <div className="example-box">

              <h4>Understanding Language in Global Contexts</h4>
              <p>Globalization has profound effects on language use, including the spread of certain languages, language endangerment, and the emergence of new varieties adapted for global communication.</p>

              <h4>Globalization Effects on Language</h4>

              <h5>1. Language Spread and Diffusion</h5>
              <div className="example-box">
                <p>Certain languages spread globally due to economic, political, and cultural power:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li><strong>English:</strong> Global lingua franca due to British colonialism and US economic power</li>
                  <li><strong>Spanish:</strong> Spreading due to Latin American population growth</li>
                  <li><strong>Mandarin Chinese:</strong> Growing with China's economic rise</li>
                  <li><strong>Arabic:</strong> Spread through religion and oil wealth</li>

                </ul>
              </div>

              <h5>2. Language Endangerment</h5>
              <p>Globalization threatens linguistic diversity:</p>

                <ul>
                  <li><strong>Statistics:</strong> A language dies every 2 weeks</li>
                  <li><strong>At risk:</strong> About 40% of 7,000+ world languages</li>
                  <li><strong>Causes:</strong> Economic pressure, urbanization, education in dominant languages</li>
                  <li><strong>Loss:</strong> Cultural knowledge, unique worldviews disappear</li>
                  <li><strong>Example:</strong> Many indigenous languages have fewer than 1,000 speakers</li>
                </ul>
              </div>

              <h5>3. English as Lingua Franca (ELF)</h5>
              <p>English used as common language between non-native speakers:</p>
              
              <ul>
