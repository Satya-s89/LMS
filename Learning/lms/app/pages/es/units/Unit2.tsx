                <p>Water is like bandwidth for life - everyone needs it, there's never enough where you need it most, and managing it efficiently is crucial for everything to work!  As engineers, you'll encounter water in manufacturing (chip production needs ultra-pure water), cooling systems (data centers use millions of gallons), and even in making your devices. Understanding water isn't just environmental awareness - it's understanding a critical constraint in almost every engineering system!</p>

              <h5>Groundwater Resources</h5>
              <div className="example-box">
                <p>Groundwater is like the dark web of water - massive, hidden, often more reliable than surface sources, but harder to monitor and protect!</p>
                <ul>

              <div className="example-box">
                <p>Droughts are like running out of memory - everything slows down and eventually crashes!</p>
                <ul>
