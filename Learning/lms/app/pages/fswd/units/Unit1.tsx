              <h3>Welcome to Modern React Development with Vite</h3>
              <div className="theory-box">
                <p><strong>Vite</strong> (French word for "quick") is the next-generation frontend build tool that's revolutionizing how we develop React applications. Think of it as the Formula 1 race car of build tools – blazingly fast, incredibly efficient, and designed for the modern web!</p>
                
                <div className="performance-metrics">
                  <h4>Why Vite? The Speed Revolution</h4>
                  <p>Traditional build tools like Create React App can feel slow. Vite changes the game:</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li><strong>Instant server start:</strong> No more waiting 30 seconds for your dev server to boot up!</li>
                    <li><strong>Lightning-fast HMR:</strong> See your changes in milliseconds, not seconds</li>
                    <li><strong>Optimized builds:</strong> Production builds that are lean and mean</li>
                    <li><strong>Native ES modules:</strong> Leverages modern browser capabilities for speed</li>
                  </ul>
                </div>
              </div>
              
              <h4>What Makes Vite Special?</h4>
              <div className="example-box">
                <p>Vite isn't just another build tool – it's a complete paradigm shift:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li><strong>No bundling in dev:</strong> Serves your code as native ES modules</li>
                  <li><strong>On-demand compilation:</strong> Only compiles what you're actually viewing</li>
                  <li><strong>Pre-configured:</strong> Works out of the box with React, TypeScript, and more</li>
                  <li><strong>Plugin ecosystem:</strong> Extend functionality with Rollup-compatible plugins</li>
                </ul>
              </div>

              <h4>The Traditional Problem</h4>
              <div className="theory-box">
                <h5>Why Old Build Tools Feel Slow</h5>
                <ul>
                  <li><strong>Bundle everything first:</strong> Webpack bundles your entire app before you can start</li>
                  <li><strong>Slow HMR:</strong> Hot Module Replacement gets slower as your app grows</li>
                  <li><strong>Complex configuration:</strong> Requires extensive setup and tweaking</li>
                  <li><strong>Large bundle sizes:</strong> Everything gets bundled, even in development</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h5>The Vite Solution</h5>
                <p>Vite leverages native ES modules in the browser during development. Instead of bundling everything upfront, it serves your source files directly and lets the browser handle imports. This means instant server start and lightning-fast updates!</p>
              </div>

              <h4>How Vite Works: The Magic Behind the Speed</h4>
              <div className="comparison-table">
                <h5>Development Mode</h5>
                <ul>
                  <li><strong>Native ESM:</strong> Browser loads modules directly via import statements</li>
                  <li><strong>esbuild:</strong> Pre-bundles dependencies using Go-based esbuild (10-100x faster than JavaScript)</li>
                  <li><strong>On-demand transformation:</strong> Only transforms files when requested by the browser</li>
                  <li><strong>Smart caching:</strong> HTTP headers ensure dependencies are cached efficiently</li>
                </ul>

                <h5>Production Mode</h5>
                <ul>
                  <li><strong>Rollup bundling:</strong> Uses Rollup for optimized production builds</li>
                  <li><strong>Code splitting:</strong> Automatic chunking for optimal loading</li>
                  <li><strong>Tree shaking:</strong> Removes unused code automatically</li>
                  <li><strong>Asset optimization:</strong> Compresses and optimizes all assets</li>
                </ul>
              </div>

              <h4>Key Features You'll Love</h4>
              <div className="example-box">
                <h5>1. Instant Server Start</h5>
                <p>No matter how large your project, Vite starts in milliseconds. It doesn't need to bundle anything before serving your app!</p>
                
                <h5>2. Lightning Fast HMR</h5>
                <p>Hot Module Replacement that stays fast regardless of app size. Changes reflect instantly in your browser.</p>
                
                <h5>3. Rich Features Out of the Box</h5>

                <p>Let's get hands-on! In this module, we'll walk through the complete setup process for creating a React application with Vite.</p>
              </div>
              
              <h4>Step 1: Prerequisites Check</h4>
              <div className="example-box">
                <p>Before we begin, ensure you have:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li><strong>Node.js:</strong> Version 14.18+ or 16+ installed</li>
                  <li><strong>npm or yarn:</strong> Package manager (comes with Node.js)</li>
                  <li><strong>Code editor:</strong> VS Code recommended</li>
                  <li><strong>Terminal:</strong> Command line access</li>
                </ul>
              </div>

              <h4>Step 2: Creating Your First Vite Project</h4>
              <div className="theory-box">
                <h5>Using npm</h5>
                <p><code>npm create vite@latest my-react-app -- --template react</code></p>
                
                <h5>Using yarn</h5>
                <p><code>yarn create vite my-react-app --template react</code></p>
                
                <h5>What This Command Does</h5>
                <ul>
                  <li>Creates a new directory with your project name</li>
                  <li>Sets up the basic Vite configuration</li>
                  <li>Installs React and React DOM</li>
                  <li>Creates a starter template with example components</li>
                </ul>
              </div>

              <h4>Step 3: Understanding the Project Structure</h4>
              <div className="example-box">
                <p>Your new Vite project contains:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li><strong>node_modules/:</strong> All dependencies</li>
                  <li><strong>public/:</strong> Static assets (images, fonts)</li>
                  <li><strong>src/:</strong> Your React components and code</li>
                  <li><strong>index.html:</strong> Entry point (in root, not public!)</li>
                  <li><strong>package.json:</strong> Project configuration and scripts</li>
                  <li><strong>vite.config.js:</strong> Vite-specific settings</li>
                </ul>
              </div>

              <h4>Step 4: Installing Dependencies</h4>
              <div className="theory-box">
                <p>Navigate to your project and install dependencies:</p>
                <p><code>cd my-react-app</code></p>
                <p><code>npm install</code></p>
              </div>

              <h4>Step 5: Starting the Development Server</h4>
              <div className="example-box">
                <p>Run the development server:</p>
                <p><code>npm run dev</code></p>
                <p>Your app will be available at <code>http://localhost:5173</code></p>

                <p>The configuration file controls Vite's behavior:</p>
                <ul>

                <h5>Setting Up Path Aliases</h5>
                <p>Create shortcuts for imports (e.g., @components instead of ../../components)</p>
                
                <h5>Environment Variables</h5>
                <p>Use .env files for different environments (development, production)</p>
