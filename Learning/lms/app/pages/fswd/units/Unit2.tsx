              <div className="theory-box">
                <p><strong>Deployment</strong> is the process of taking your beautifully crafted React application and making it available to the world! Think of it as moving from your cozy development environment to the big stage where real users can access your app 24/7.</p>
                
                <div className="performance-metrics">
                  <h4>Why Deployment Matters</h4>
                  <p>Your app running on localhost:3000 is great, but it's time to go global:</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li><strong>Accessibility:</strong> Anyone with internet can access your app from anywhere</li>
                    <li><strong>Performance:</strong> Optimized builds load faster than development versions</li>
                    <li><strong>Reliability:</strong> Professional hosting ensures your app stays online</li>
                    <li><strong>Scalability:</strong> Handle thousands of users simultaneously</li>
                  </ul>
                </div>
              </div>
              
              <h4>The Deployment Journey</h4>
              <div className="example-box">
                <p>Deploying a frontend app involves several key steps:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li><strong>Build:</strong> Create an optimized production version of your app</li>
                  <li><strong>Choose a host:</strong> Select where your app will live (Vercel, Netlify, etc.)</li>
                  <li><strong>Configure:</strong> Set up environment variables and build settings</li>
                  <li><strong>Deploy:</strong> Upload your build to the hosting platform</li>
                  <li><strong>Monitor:</strong> Track performance and fix issues</li>
                </ul>
              </div>

              <h4>Development vs Production</h4>
              <div className="theory-box">
                <h5>Understanding the Difference</h5>
                <ul>
                  <li><strong>Development mode:</strong> Fast refresh, detailed errors, unoptimized code</li>
                  <li><strong>Production mode:</strong> Minified code, optimized assets, error tracking</li>
                  <li><strong>File size:</strong> Dev builds are large, production builds are compressed</li>
                  <li><strong>Performance:</strong> Production builds are significantly faster</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h5>What Happens During Build?</h5>
                <p>When you run npm run build, Vite performs magic behind the scenes: minifies JavaScript, optimizes images, removes unused code (tree-shaking), bundles everything efficiently, and generates static HTML files.</p>
              </div>

              <h4>Popular Deployment Platforms</h4>
              <div className="comparison-table">

                </ul>
              </div>

              <h4>Key Deployment Concepts</h4>
              <div className="example-box">
                <h5>1. Static Site Generation (SSG)</h5>
                <p>Your React app is built into static HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files that can be served from any web server or CDN.</p>
                
                <h5>2. Environment Variables</h5>
                <p>Store sensitive data like API keys separately from your code. Different values for development and production.</p>
                
                <h5>3. Build Optimization</h5>
                <ul>
                  <li>Code splitting for faster initial load</li>
                  <li>Asset compression (gzip/brotli)</li>
                  <li>Image optimization</li>
                  <li>Lazy loading for better performance</li>
                </ul>

                <h5>4. Continuous Deployment</h5>
                <p>Automatically deploy your app whenever you push code to your repository. No manual uploads needed!</p>
              </div>

              <h4>Prerequisites for Deployment</h4>
              <div className="theory-box">
                <p>Before deploying, make sure you have:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li><strong>Working build:</strong> npm run build completes without errors</li>
                  <li><strong>Git repository:</strong> Code pushed to GitHub/GitLab/Bitbucket</li>
                  <li><strong>Account:</strong> Sign up for your chosen hosting platform</li>
                  <li><strong>Environment variables:</strong> Configured for production</li>
                </ul>
              </div>

                </ul>
              </div>

              <div className="theory-box">
                <h4>Pro Tip</h4>
                <p><strong>Test your production build locally first!</strong> Run npm run build followed by npm run preview to see exactly how your app will behave in production before deploying.</p>
