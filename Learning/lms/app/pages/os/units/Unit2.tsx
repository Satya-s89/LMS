              <h3>Process Operations</h3>

              <h4>1. Process Creation</h4>
              <p>A process may create several new processes during execution. The creating process is called parent, and new processes are called children.</p>
              
              <div className="example-box">
                <h5>Process Creation Steps</h5>
                <ol>
                  <li>Process Request (fork/exec system call)</li>
                  <li>Allocate Process Control Block (PCB)</li>
                  <li>Assign Unique Process ID (PID)</li>
                  <li>Allocate Memory Space</li>
                  <li>Initialize PCB with process attributes</li>
                  <li>Load program code and data into memory</li>
                  <li>Set initial register values and program counter</li>
                  <li>Insert process into ready queue</li>
                  <li>Process becomes eligible for scheduling</li>
                </ol>
              </div>

              <h5>Process Creation Methods:</h5>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>fork():</strong> Create child process (Unix/Linux)</li>
                <li><strong>exec():</strong> Replace process image with new program</li>
                <li><strong>spawn():</strong> Create and execute new process (Windows)</li>
                <li><strong>system():</strong> Execute command via shell</li>
              </ul>

              <h5>Process Hierarchy:</h5>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Parent Process:</strong> Creates other processes</li>
                <li><strong>Child Process:</strong> Created by parent process</li>
                <li><strong>Process Tree:</strong> Hierarchical process organization</li>
                <li><strong>Zombie Process:</strong> Terminated but not cleaned up by parent</li>
                <li><strong>Orphan Process:</strong> Parent terminated before child</li>
              </ul>

              <h4>2. Process Termination</h4>
              <p>Process terminates when it finishes executing its final statement.</p>
              
              <h5>Termination Conditions:</h5>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Normal completion:</strong> exit() system call</li>
                <li><strong>Fatal error:</strong> Segmentation fault, divide by zero</li>
                <li><strong>Killed by another process:</strong> kill() system call</li>
                <li><strong>Parent termination:</strong> Cascading termination of children</li>
              </ul>

              <div className="example-box">
                <h5>Example: fork() System Call</h5>
                <p>In Unix/Linux, fork() creates a child process:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Returns 0 to child process</li>
                  <li>Returns child's PID to parent process</li>
                  <li>Returns -1 if creation fails</li>
                  <li>Child is duplicate of parent with separate memory space</li>
