              <h3>Swapping</h3>
              <p>Swapping is a memory management technique that allows the operating system to temporarily move processes from main memory to secondary storage (disk) and vice versa. This enables the system to run more processes than can fit in physical memory simultaneously.</p>

              <h4>Swapping Fundamentals:</h4>
              <p>Swapping involves moving entire processes between main memory (RAM) and a backing store (swap space on disk):</p>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Swap Out:</strong> Move process from RAM to disk to free memory</li>
                <li><strong>Swap In:</strong> Move process from disk back to RAM for execution</li>
                <li><strong>Backing Store:</strong> Fast disk area with sufficient capacity for all process images</li>
                <li><strong>Swap Space:</strong> Dedicated disk area for swapped processes</li>
              </ul>

                <h5>Swapping Operation Sequence</h5>
                <ol>
                  <li><strong>Process Selection:</strong> Evaluate priority, memory usage, I/O activity</li>
                  <li><strong>Prepare for Swap-Out:</strong> Save process state (registers, PC), update PCB</li>
                  <li><strong>Write to Backing Store:</strong> Copy entire process image to swap space</li>
                  <li><strong>Free Memory:</strong> Release main memory for other processes</li>
                  <li><strong>Swap-In When Needed:</strong> Locate on disk, allocate memory, copy back</li>
                  <li><strong>Resume Execution:</strong> Update PCB and scheduling queues</li>
                </ol>
              </div>

              <h4>Swapping Triggers:</h4>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Memory Pressure:</strong> Insufficient free memory for new processes</li>
                <li><strong>Process Priority:</strong> Lower priority processes swapped to favor higher priority</li>
                <li><strong>System Load:</strong> Balance between memory availability and CPU usage</li>
                <li><strong>Process Behavior:</strong> I/O-bound processes may be swapped during I/O operations</li>

              <h3>Contiguous Memory Allocation</h3>
              <p>Contiguous memory allocation schemes divide memory into partitions where each process occupies a single contiguous block of memory. Two main approaches exist: Fixed Partitioning (MFT) and Variable Partitioning (MVT).</p>

              <h4>MFT (Multiple Fixed Tasks) - Fixed Partitioning</h4>
              <p>Memory is divided into fixed-size partitions at system startup. Each partition can hold exactly one process.</p>

              <ul>
                <li><strong>Partition Size:</strong> Fixed at system initialization</li>
                <li><strong>Allocation:</strong> Fit process into appropriately sized partition</li>
                <li><strong>Internal Fragmentation:</strong> Unused space within partition (major issue)</li>
                <li><strong>External Fragmentation:</strong> Not applicable</li>
                <li><strong>Implementation:</strong> Simple and fast</li>
              </ul>

              <div className="example-box">
                <h5>MFT Example</h5>
                <p>Memory: 100KB total divided into partitions:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>4 partitions of 10KB each</li>
                  <li>3 partitions of 20KB each</li>
                  <li>1 partition of 40KB</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Process Allocation:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Process A (15KB) → 20KB partition (5KB internal fragmentation)</li>
                  <li>Process B (8KB) → 10KB partition (2KB internal fragmentation)</li>
                  <li>Process C (35KB) → 40KB partition (5KB internal fragmentation)</li>

              <h4>MVT (Multiple Variable Tasks) - Variable Partitioning</h4>
              <p>Memory is dynamically divided into partitions of variable sizes based on process requirements.</p>

              <ul>
                <li><strong>Partition Size:</strong> Dynamically allocated based on process size</li>
                <li><strong>Allocation:</strong> Allocate exactly required space</li>
                <li><strong>Internal Fragmentation:</strong> None (perfect fit)</li>
                <li><strong>External Fragmentation:</strong> Accumulates over time (major issue)</li>
                <li><strong>Compaction:</strong> Required periodically to consolidate free space</li>
              </ul>

              <div className="example-box">
                <h5>MVT Example</h5>
                <p><strong>Initial State:</strong> [Unused 100KB]</p>

                <p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Process A terminates → [Unused:20KB][B:30KB][C:25KB][Unused:25KB]</p>
                <p><strong>External Fragmentation:</strong> 45KB free but in 2 separate blocks!</p>
                <p>Cannot allocate a 40KB process even though total free space is 45KB</p>
              </div>

              <h4>Allocation Strategies for MVT:</h4>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>First Fit:</strong> Allocate first hole large enough (fast)</li>
                <li><strong>Best Fit:</strong> Allocate smallest hole large enough (minimizes waste)</li>
                <li><strong>Worst Fit:</strong> Allocate largest hole (leaves larger remaining holes)</li>

              <h3>Non-Contiguous Memory Allocation</h3>
              <p>Non-contiguous memory allocation allows processes to be stored in non-adjacent memory locations, solving the fragmentation problems inherent in contiguous allocation schemes. The two main techniques are Paging and Segmentation.</p>

              <h3>Paging</h3>
              <p>Paging is a memory management scheme that eliminates the need for contiguous allocation of physical memory. It divides both logical memory (process address space) and physical memory into fixed-size blocks.</p>

              <h4>Paging Concepts:</h4>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Page:</strong> Fixed-size block of logical memory (typically 4KB)</li>
                <li><strong>Frame:</strong> Fixed-size block of physical memory (same size as page)</li>
                <li><strong>Page Table:</strong> Maps logical page numbers to physical frame numbers</li>
                <li><strong>Page Number (p):</strong> Index into page table</li>
                <li><strong>Page Offset (d):</strong> Offset within the page/frame</li>

                <li><strong>Page Number (p):</strong> Used as index into page table</li>
                <li><strong>Page Offset (d):</strong> Combined with base address from page table</li>
              </ul>

              <div className="example-box">
                <h5>Paging Example</h5>
                <p><strong>System Configuration:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Page size = 4KB (4096 bytes)</li>
                  <li>Logical address space = 16KB (pages 0-3)</li>
                  <li>Physical memory = 32KB (frames 0-7)</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Page Table:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Page 0 → Frame 3</li>
                  <li>Page 1 → Frame 1</li>
                  <li>Page 2 → Frame 6</li>
                  <li>Page 3 → Frame 0</li>

                <p><strong>Address Translation:</strong></p>
                <p>Logical address 0x2000 (8192 decimal):</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Page number = 8192 / 4096 = 2</li>
                  <li>Offset = 8192 % 4096 = 0</li>
                  <li>Frame number = Page Table[2] = 6</li>
                  <li>Physical address = (6 × 4096) + 0 = 24576 (0x6000)</li>
                </ul>
              </div>

              <h4>Paging Advantages:</h4>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Eliminates External Fragmentation:</strong> Pages can be placed in any available frame</li>
                <li><strong>Simple Allocation:</strong> Any free frame can be allocated to any page</li>
                <li><strong>Sharing:</strong> Multiple processes can share same physical pages (code sharing)</li>
                <li><strong>Protection:</strong> Per-page access control (read, write, execute bits)</li>
                <li><strong>Virtual Memory Support:</strong> Foundation for demand paging</li>
              </ul>

              <h4>Paging Disadvantages:</h4>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Internal Fragmentation:</strong> Last page may be partially filled (average 0.5 page per process)</li>
                <li><strong>Page Table Overhead:</strong> Storage space for page tables</li>
                <li><strong>Translation Overhead:</strong> Time to translate addresses</li>
                <li><strong>No Logical Division:</strong> Doesn't reflect program structure</li>
                <li><strong>TLB Required:</strong> Need Translation Lookaside Buffer for performance</li>
              </ul>

              <h4>Page Table Structure:</h4>
              <p>Each page table entry typically contains:</p>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Frame Number:</strong> Physical frame location</li>
                <li><strong>Valid/Invalid Bit:</strong> Indicates if page is in memory</li>
                <li><strong>Protection Bits:</strong> Read, write, execute permissions</li>
                <li><strong>Reference Bit:</strong> Set when page is accessed</li>
                <li><strong>Modified (Dirty) Bit:</strong> Set when page is written to</li>
              </ul>

              <h3>Segmentation</h3>
              <p>Segmentation is a memory management scheme that supports the user's view of memory. A program is a collection of segments such as main program, procedures, functions, methods, objects, local variables, global variables, common block, stack, symbol table, and arrays.</p>

              <h4>Segmentation Concepts:</h4>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Segment:</strong> Variable-sized logical unit (code, data, stack)</li>
                <li><strong>Segment Table:</strong> Maps segment numbers to base addresses and limits</li>
                <li><strong>Segment Number (s):</strong> Index into segment table</li>
                <li><strong>Segment Offset (d):</strong> Offset within the segment</li>
              </ul>

              <h4>Segment Table Entry:</h4>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Base:</strong> Starting physical address of segment</li>
                <li><strong>Limit:</strong> Length of segment (for bounds checking)</li>
                <li><strong>Protection Bits:</strong> Access rights for segment</li>
              </ul>

              <div className="example-box">
                <h5>Segmentation Example</h5>
                <p><strong>Process Segments:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Segment 0 (Code): 10KB</li>
                  <li>Segment 1 (Data): 5KB</li>
                  <li>Segment 2 (Stack): 2KB</li>

                  <li>Segment 2: Base=30000, Limit=2048</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Address Translation:</strong></p>
                <p>Logical address (2, 1000) = Segment 2, offset 1000:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Check: offset (1000) &lt; limit (2048) ✓ Valid</li>
                  <li>Physical address = Base + Offset = 30000 + 1000 = 31000</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Logical address (2, 3000) = Segment 2, offset 3000:</p>
                <ul>

                </ul>
              </div>

              <h4>Segmentation Advantages:</h4>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Logical Division:</strong> Matches program structure naturally</li>
                <li><strong>Sharing:</strong> Easy to share logical entities (code segments)</li>
                <li><strong>Protection:</strong> Per-segment access rights (code read-only, data read-write)</li>
                <li><strong>Dynamic Growth:</strong> Segments can grow during execution</li>
                <li><strong>Modularity:</strong> Supports modular programming</li>
              </ul>

              <h4>Segmentation Disadvantages:</h4>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>External Fragmentation:</strong> Variable-size segments cause fragmentation</li>
                <li><strong>Complexity:</strong> More complex than paging</li>
                <li><strong>Segment Table Overhead:</strong> Storage and access time</li>
                <li><strong>Compaction Required:</strong> Periodic compaction needed</li>

              <h3>Virtual Memory</h3>
              <p>Virtual memory is a memory management technique that provides an idealized abstraction of the storage resources actually available on a machine. It creates an illusion for users of a very large (main) memory by treating a portion of secondary storage as though it were part of main memory.</p>

              <h4>Virtual Memory Concepts:</h4>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Virtual Address Space:</strong> Logical addresses seen by programs (can be larger than physical memory)</li>
                <li><strong>Physical Address Space:</strong> Actual memory locations in RAM</li>
                <li><strong>Address Translation:</strong> Convert virtual addresses to physical addresses</li>
                <li><strong>Page Fault:</strong> Occurs when accessing a page not in physical memory</li>
              </ul>

              <div className="image-container">
                <img src="https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20250115142221545470/virtual_memory.webp" alt="Virtual Memory" />
                <p className="image-caption">Figure 4.4: Virtual Memory Concept</p>
              </div>

              <h4>Virtual Memory Benefits:</h4>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Memory Extension:</strong> Run programs larger than physical memory</li>
                <li><strong>Process Isolation:</strong> Each process has separate address space</li>
                <li><strong>Memory Protection:</strong> Prevent processes from interfering with each other</li>
                <li><strong>Memory Sharing:</strong> Share code and data between processes efficiently</li>
                <li><strong>Simplified Programming:</strong> Programmers don't worry about physical memory limits</li>
                <li><strong>More Processes:</strong> More processes can be in memory simultaneously</li>
              </ul>

              <h3>Demand Paging</h3>
              <p>Demand paging is a method of virtual memory management where pages are loaded into memory only when they are demanded (accessed) during program execution, rather than loading the entire program at startup.</p>

              <h4>Demand Paging Process:</h4>
              <div className="example-box">
                <h5>Demand Paging Steps</h5>
                <ol>
                  <li><strong>Process Starts:</strong> No pages loaded initially (or minimal pages)</li>
                  <li><strong>First Access:</strong> CPU tries to access a page not in memory</li>
                  <li><strong>Page Fault:</strong> Hardware trap to OS (page fault exception)</li>
                  <li><strong>Validity Check:</strong> OS checks if reference is valid</li>
                  <li><strong>Find Free Frame:</strong> Locate free frame in physical memory</li>
                  <li><strong>Load Page:</strong> Read page from disk into frame</li>
                  <li><strong>Update Page Table:</strong> Mark page as valid, set frame number</li>
                  <li><strong>Restart Instruction:</strong> Resume execution from faulting instruction</li>
                </ol>
              </div>

              <h4>Page Table Entries in Demand Paging:</h4>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Valid Bit:</strong> 1 = page in memory, 0 = page on disk</li>
                <li><strong>Frame Number:</strong> Physical frame location (if valid)</li>
                <li><strong>Disk Address:</strong> Location on disk (if invalid)</li>
                <li><strong>Reference Bit:</strong> Set when page is accessed</li>
                <li><strong>Modified (Dirty) Bit:</strong> Set when page is written to</li>
                <li><strong>Protection Bits:</strong> Read, write, execute permissions</li>
              </ul>

              <div className="example-box">
                <h5>Page Fault Handling Example</h5>
                <p><strong>Scenario:</strong> Process tries to access page 5</p>
                <ol>
                  <li>CPU generates address with page number 5</li>
                  <li>MMU checks page table: Valid bit = 0 (not in memory)</li>
                  <li>Page fault trap to OS</li>
                  <li>OS checks: Is page 5 valid for this process? Yes</li>
                  <li>OS finds free frame (e.g., frame 7)</li>
                  <li>OS issues disk I/O to read page 5 into frame 7</li>
                  <li>OS updates page table: Page 5 → Frame 7, Valid = 1</li>
                  <li>OS returns from trap, instruction restarts</li>
                  <li>CPU accesses frame 7 successfully</li>
                </ol>
              </div>

              <h4>Demand Paging Advantages:</h4>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Reduced I/O:</strong> Only load needed pages, not entire program</li>
                <li><strong>Less Memory Usage:</strong> Only active pages in memory</li>
                <li><strong>Fast Startup:</strong> No initial loading delay</li>
                <li><strong>Greater Multiprogramming:</strong> More processes can fit in memory</li>
                <li><strong>Efficient Memory Use:</strong> Unused code never loaded</li>
              </ul>

              <h4>Demand Paging Considerations:</h4>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Page Fault Overhead:</strong> Time to handle page faults (disk I/O is slow)</li>
                <li><strong>Thrashing Risk:</strong> Too many page faults degrade performance</li>
                <li><strong>Working Set:</strong> Need to keep frequently used pages in memory</li>
                <li><strong>Replacement Strategy:</strong> Which page to evict when memory is full</li>
              </ul>

              <h4>Effective Access Time (EAT):</h4>

                <h5>EAT Calculation</h5>
                <p><strong>Formula:</strong> EAT = (1 - p) × memory_access_time + p × page_fault_time</p>
                <p>Where p = page fault rate (0 ≤ p ≤ 1)</p>
                <p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Memory access time = 200 nanoseconds</li>
                  <li>Page fault time = 8 milliseconds = 8,000,000 nanoseconds</li>
                  <li>Page fault rate = 0.001 (1 fault per 1000 accesses)</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Calculation:</strong></p>
                <p>EAT = (1 - 0.001) × 200 + 0.001 × 8,000,000</p>
                <p>EAT = 0.999 × 200 + 8,000</p>
                <p>EAT = 199.8 + 8,000 = 8,199.8 nanoseconds</p>

              <h4>Pure Demand Paging:</h4>
              <p>Start process with no pages in memory. First instruction causes page fault, then every page is brought in as needed. This is the extreme case.</p>

              <h4>Prepaging:</h4>
              <p>Opposite of pure demand paging. Load multiple pages at once based on prediction. Reduces page faults but may load unnecessary pages.</p>

              <h4>Copy-on-Write (COW):</h4>
              <p>Optimization for process creation:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Parent and child initially share same pages</li>
                <li>Pages marked as copy-on-write</li>
                <li>When either process writes, page is copied</li>
                <li>Saves memory and time for fork() operations</li>

              <h3>Page Replacement Algorithms</h3>
              <p>When memory is full and a page fault occurs, the OS must select a victim page to evict (replace) to make room for the new page. Different algorithms have different performance characteristics measured by page fault rate.</p>

              <h4>Algorithm Selection Criteria:</h4>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Page Fault Rate:</strong> Minimize number of page faults</li>
                <li><strong>Implementation Complexity:</strong> Practical to implement</li>
                <li><strong>Performance:</strong> Overall system efficiency</li>
                <li><strong>Overhead:</strong> Time and space requirements</li>
              </ul>

              <h3>1. FIFO (First-In, First-Out)</h3>
              <p>The simplest page replacement algorithm. Replace the oldest page in memory (the one that has been in memory the longest).</p>

              <div className="example-box">

              <h4>FIFO Advantages:</h4>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Simplicity:</strong> Easy to understand and implement</li>
                <li><strong>Low Overhead:</strong> Just need a queue</li>
                <li><strong>Predictability:</strong> Deterministic behavior</li>
                <li><strong>Fairness:</strong> Each page gets equal time</li>
              </ul>

              <h4>FIFO Disadvantages:</h4>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Belady's Anomaly:</strong> More frames can cause MORE page faults</li>
                <li><strong>Ignores Usage:</strong> Doesn't consider access patterns</li>
                <li><strong>Suboptimal:</strong> Often higher fault rates</li>
                <li><strong>Old Important Pages:</strong> May evict frequently used pages</li>
              </ul>

              <div className="example-box">
                <h5>Belady's Anomaly Example</h5>
                <p><strong>Reference String:</strong> 1, 2, 3, 4, 1, 2, 5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5</p>
                <p><strong>With 3 frames:</strong> 9 page faults</p>
                <p><strong>With 4 frames:</strong> 10 page faults (more!)</p>
                <p>This counterintuitive behavior is unique to FIFO</p>

              <h3>Thrashing</h3>
              <p>Thrashing is a severe performance problem that occurs when a computer's virtual memory resources become saturated, leading to a constant state of paging. The system spends more time swapping pages than executing processes.</p>

              <div className="example-box">
                <h5>Thrashing Cycle</h5>
                <ol>
                  <li>Process A needs page X → page fault</li>
                  <li>OS swaps in page X, evicts page Y from Process B</li>
                  <li>Process B needs page Y → page fault</li>
                  <li>OS swaps in page Y, evicts page Z from Process C</li>
                  <li>Process C needs page Z → page fault</li>
                  <li>Cycle continues with excessive swapping</li>
                  <li>CPU utilization drops dramatically</li>

              <h4>Thrashing Detection:</h4>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>High Page Fault Rate:</strong> Frequent page faults</li>
                <li><strong>Low CPU Utilization:</strong> CPU mostly idle waiting for I/O</li>
                <li><strong>High Disk Utilization:</strong> Disk constantly active</li>
                <li><strong>Slow Response:</strong> System becomes unresponsive</li>
              </ul>

              <h4>Thrashing Causes:</h4>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Over-allocation:</strong> Too many processes for available memory</li>
                <li><strong>Working Set Exceeds Memory:</strong> Process needs exceed available frames</li>
                <li><strong>Poor Locality:</strong> Random memory access patterns</li>
                <li><strong>Inadequate Replacement:</strong> Poor page replacement strategy</li>

              <h4>Thrashing Solutions:</h4>
              <ul>
