              <h3>Operating System Operations</h3>
              
              <h4>Dual-Mode Operation</h4>
              <p>Modern operating systems operate in two modes to protect the system from errant programs:</p>
              
              <ul>
                <li><strong>User Mode:</strong> Execution mode for user applications with restricted access</li>
                <li><strong>Kernel Mode (Supervisor Mode):</strong> Execution mode for OS with unrestricted access to hardware</li>
              </ul>

              <div className="image-container">
                <img src="https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/dual_mode.jpeg" alt="Dual Mode" />
                <p className="image-caption">Figure 1.6: Dual-mode operation in Operating Systems</p>
              </div>

              <p>A mode bit is added to hardware to indicate current mode:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Mode bit = 0: Kernel mode</li>
                <li>Mode bit = 1: User mode</li>
              </ul>

              <h4>System Boot Process</h4>
              <p>The process of starting a computer and loading the operating system:</p>
              <ol>
                <li><strong>Power On:</strong> Computer is powered on</li>
                <li><strong>BIOS/UEFI:</strong> Basic Input/Output System initializes hardware</li>
                <li><strong>Bootstrap Loader:</strong> Small program in ROM loads OS</li>
                <li><strong>OS Kernel:</strong> Kernel is loaded into memory</li>
                <li><strong>System Initialization:</strong> System services and drivers are started</li>
                <li><strong>User Login:</strong> System ready for user interaction</li>
              </ol>

              <h4>Interrupts</h4>
              <p>Interrupts are signals that cause the CPU to stop current execution and handle the interrupt:</p>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Hardware Interrupts:</strong> Generated by hardware devices (I/O completion)</li>
                <li><strong>Software Interrupts (Traps):</strong> Generated by software (system calls, errors)</li>
              </ul>

                <p className="image-caption">Figure 1.7: Interrupt handling mechanism</p>
              </div>

              <h4>Timer</h4>
              <p>A timer prevents infinite loops and ensures CPU time sharing:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Set to interrupt computer after specific period</li>
                <li>Prevents user programs from monopolizing CPU</li>
                <li>Used in time-sharing systems</li>
              </ul>

              <h3>Protection and Security</h3>

              <h4>Protection</h4>
              <p>Protection is a mechanism for controlling access of processes or users to resources:</p>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Memory Protection:</strong> Prevents processes from accessing unauthorized memory</li>
                <li><strong>CPU Protection:</strong> Timer prevents infinite loops</li>
                <li><strong>I/O Protection:</strong> All I/O instructions are privileged</li>
              </ul>

              <h4>Protection Concepts:</h4>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Domain of Protection:</strong> Set of access rights (read, write, execute) for each process</li>
                <li><strong>Access Matrix:</strong> Defines which subjects can access which objects and how</li>
                <li><strong>Access Control:</strong> Mechanisms to enforce protection policies (ACLs, capabilities)</li>
                <li><strong>Revocation:</strong> Ability to remove access rights when no longer needed</li>
              </ul>

              <div className="example-box">
                <h5>Example: Memory Protection</h5>
                <p>When Process A tries to access memory belonging to Process B, the OS uses base and limit registers to detect the violation and terminates Process A with a segmentation fault error.</p>
              </div>

              <h4>Security</h4>
              <p>Security defends the system against internal and external attacks:</p>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Authentication:</strong> User identity verification (passwords, biometrics)</li>
                <li><strong>Authorization:</strong> Determining access rights</li>
                <li><strong>Encryption:</strong> Protecting data confidentiality</li>
                <li><strong>Firewall:</strong> Network security</li>
              </ul>

                <li><strong>Malware:</strong> Viruses, worms, trojans, ransomware</li>
                <li><strong>Denial of Service (DoS):</strong> Overwhelming system resources</li>
                <li><strong>Unauthorized Access:</strong> Breaking into systems</li>

              <h3>System Calls</h3>
              <p>System calls provide an interface between a process and the operating system. They are the only way for user programs to interact with the kernel.</p>

              <h4>Types of System Calls:</h4>

              <h5>1. Process Control</h5>
              <ul>
                <li>create process (fork())</li>
                <li>terminate process (exit())</li>
                <li>load, execute</li>
                <li>get/set process attributes</li>

                <li>allocate and free memory</li>
              </ul>

              <h5>2. File Management</h5>
              <ul>
                <li>create file, delete file</li>
                <li>open, close</li>

                <li>get/set file attributes</li>
              </ul>

              <h5>3. Device Management</h5>
              <ul>
                <li>request device, release device</li>
                <li>read, write, reposition</li>

              </div>

              <h4>System Call Implementation</h4>
              <p>System calls are typically accessed through an Application Programming Interface (API):</p>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Win32 API:</strong> For Windows systems</li>
                <li><strong>POSIX API:</strong> For UNIX, Linux, Mac OS X</li>
                <li><strong>Java API:</strong> For Java Virtual Machine</li>
              </ul>

              <div className="example-box">
                <h5>Example: System Call Execution</h5>
                <p>When a program calls printf("Hello"), it:</p>
                <ol>
                  <li>Invokes the write() system call through C library</li>
                  <li>Switches from user mode to kernel mode</li>
                  <li>OS kernel handles the I/O operation</li>
                  <li>Returns control to user mode</li>
                </ol>
              </div>

              <h4>Parameter Passing in System Calls:</h4>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Registers:</strong> Parameters passed in CPU registers (fastest, limited number)</li>
                <li><strong>Block/Table:</strong> Parameters stored in memory block, address passed in register</li>
                <li><strong>Stack:</strong> Parameters pushed onto stack by program, popped by OS</li>
              </ul>

              <h3>Operating System Structures</h3>

              <h4>1. Simple Structure (MS-DOS)</h4>
              <p>No well-defined structure, written to provide maximum functionality in minimal space.</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Not divided into modules</li>
                <li>Interfaces and levels of functionality not well separated</li>
                <li>Application programs can access hardware directly</li>
              </ul>

              <h4>2. Layered Approach</h4>
              <p>OS is divided into layers, each built on top of lower layers.</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Layer 0: Hardware</li>
                <li>Layer N: User interface</li>
                <li>Each layer uses functions of lower layers only</li>
                <li>Easier to debug and verify</li>
              </ul>

              </div>

              <h4>3. Monolithic Structure</h4>
              <p>Entire OS runs in kernel space as a single program.</p>
              <ul>
                <li>All services in kernel space</li>
                <li>Fast performance (no message passing overhead)</li>
                <li>Difficult to maintain and extend</li>
                <li>Examples: Traditional Unix, Linux</li>
              </ul>

              <h4>4. Microkernel Structure</h4>
              <p>Minimal kernel with most services in user space.</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Only essential services in kernel (IPC, memory management, CPU scheduling)</li>

                <h5>Example: Linux Modular Structure</h5>
                <p>Linux uses a modular approach where device drivers can be loaded dynamically:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Load USB driver: <code>modprobe usb_storage</code></li>
                  <li>List loaded modules: <code>lsmod</code></li>
                  <li>Remove module: <code>rmmod usb_storage</code></li>
                </ul>
                <p>This allows adding hardware support without rebooting the system.</p>
