              <h3>The Concept of a File</h3>
              <p>A file is a named collection of related information that is recorded on secondary storage. From the user's perspective, a file is the smallest allocation of logical secondary storage and represents a logical unit of information that can be accessed and manipulated.</p>

              <h4>File Fundamentals:</h4>
              <p>A file is an abstract data type that represents a sequence of bytes stored on a storage device. It serves as a container for:</p>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Data:</strong> Text, numbers, images, videos, etc.</li>
                <li><strong>Programs:</strong> Executable code and scripts</li>
                <li><strong>Documents:</strong> Text documents, spreadsheets, presentations</li>
              </ul>

              <h4>File Attributes:</h4>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Name:</strong> Human-readable string identifying the file</li>
                <li><strong>Identifier:</strong> Unique tag (inode number) for internal OS use</li>
                <li><strong>Type:</strong> File type classification (.txt, .exe, .jpg, etc.)</li>
                <li><strong>Location:</strong> Pointer to device and location on device</li>
                <li><strong>Size:</strong> Current file size in bytes</li>
                <li><strong>Protection:</strong> Access control information (read, write, execute)</li>
                <li><strong>Time/Date:</strong> Creation, last modification, last access timestamps</li>
                <li><strong>Owner:</strong> User ID of the file owner</li>
              </ul>

              <h4>File Types and Organization:</h4>
              <div className="example-box">
                <h5>Common File Types</h5>
                <p><strong>1. Source Files:</strong></p>

                </ul>
                <p><strong>3. Data Files:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Text: .txt, .csv, .log</li>
                  <li>Database: .db, .mdb, .sql</li>
                  <li>Multimedia: .mp3, .jpg, .mp4, .avi</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>4. Special Files:</strong></p>

                  <li>Symbolic links</li>
                </ul>
              </div>

              <h4>File Operations:</h4>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Create:</strong> Establish a new file in the file system</li>
                <li><strong>Delete:</strong> Remove a file and free its space</li>
                <li><strong>Open:</strong> Prepare file for access, load metadata</li>
                <li><strong>Close:</strong> Terminate access, update metadata</li>
                <li><strong>Read:</strong> Transfer data from file to process memory</li>
                <li><strong>Write:</strong> Transfer data from process memory to file</li>
                <li><strong>Reposition (Seek):</strong> Move file pointer to specific location</li>
                <li><strong>Truncate:</strong> Reduce file size, delete content</li>
                <li><strong>Append:</strong> Add data to end of file</li>
              </ul>

              <h3>Access Methods</h3>
              <p>Access methods define how files can be accessed and read. Different methods are suited for different types of applications and data processing requirements.</p>

              <h4>1. Sequential Access</h4>
              <p>Records are accessed in order, one after another. The file pointer automatically advances after each read/write operation.</p>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Process:</strong> Read/write next record sequentially</li>
                <li><strong>Pointer Movement:</strong> Automatic after each operation</li>
                <li><strong>Use Cases:</strong> Tape storage, log files, batch processing, streaming</li>
                <li><strong>Advantages:</strong> Simple, efficient for sequential processing</li>
                <li><strong>Disadvantages:</strong> Slow for random access, must read all previous records</li>
              </ul>

              <div className="example-box">
                <h5>Sequential Access Example</h5>
                <p>Reading a log file line by line:</p>
                <pre style={{background: '#f5f5f5', padding: '12px', borderRadius: '4px', overflow: 'auto'}}>
{`File: system.log
Line 1: [2024-01-01] System started
Line 2: [2024-01-01] User logged in
Line 3: [2024-01-01] File accessed

Sequential Read:
read_next() → Line 1
read_next() → Line 2
read_next() → Line 3`}
                </pre>
              </div>

              <h4>2. Direct Access (Random Access)</h4>
              <p>Any record can be accessed directly without reading previous records. The file is viewed as a numbered sequence of blocks or records.</p>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Process:</strong> Calculate position, jump directly to record</li>
                <li><strong>Pointer Movement:</strong> Explicitly positioned to desired record</li>
                <li><strong>Use Cases:</strong> Database systems, random access files, disk storage</li>
                <li><strong>Advantages:</strong> Fast access to any record, no need to read sequentially</li>
                <li><strong>Disadvantages:</strong> More complex implementation, requires record numbering</li>
              </ul>

              <div className="example-box">
                <h5>Direct Access Example</h5>
                <p>Accessing database records:</p>
                <pre style={{background: '#f5f5f5', padding: '12px', borderRadius: '4px', overflow: 'auto'}}>
{`File: database.dat (1000 records, 512 bytes each)

Direct Access:
read(record_number=500)
  → Position = 500 × 512 = 256,000 bytes
  → Seek to byte 256,000
  → Read 512 bytes

read(record_number=10)
  → Position = 10 × 512 = 5,120 bytes
  → Seek to byte 5,120
  → Read 512 bytes`}
                </pre>
              </div>

              <h4>3. Indexed Access</h4>
              <p>Uses an index table to locate records quickly. The index contains pointers to various blocks in the file.</p>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Structure:</strong> Index table + data blocks</li>
                <li><strong>Process:</strong> Search index, follow pointer to data</li>
                <li><strong>Use Cases:</strong> Large databases, frequent searches, complex queries</li>
                <li><strong>Advantages:</strong> Very fast searches, supports multiple indices</li>
                <li><strong>Disadvantages:</strong> Index storage overhead, index maintenance cost</li>
              </ul>

              <h4>Access Methods Comparison:</h4>
              <div className="table-container">

              <h3>Directory Structure</h3>
              <p>Directories (also called folders) provide a logical grouping of files and organize the file system in a hierarchical structure. They make it easier to locate, manage, and organize files efficiently.</p>

              <h4>Directory Operations:</h4>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Search:</strong> Locate files by name or attributes</li>
                <li><strong>Create:</strong> Establish new directory</li>
                <li><strong>Delete:</strong> Remove directory (must be empty or force delete)</li>
                <li><strong>List:</strong> Show directory contents</li>
                <li><strong>Rename:</strong> Change directory name</li>
                <li><strong>Traverse:</strong> Navigate through directory tree</li>
              </ul>

              <h4>Directory Structure Types:</h4>

              <h5>1. Single-Level Directory</h5>
              <p>All files are contained in a single directory. Simplest structure but has limitations.</p>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Advantages:</strong> Simple, easy to implement</li>
                <li><strong>Disadvantages:</strong> Name conflicts, no grouping, poor organization</li>
                <li><strong>Use Case:</strong> Early systems, simple embedded systems</li>
              </ul>

              <h5>2. Two-Level Directory</h5>
              <p>Separate directory for each user. Solves name conflict problem.</p>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Structure:</strong> Master File Directory (MFD) + User File Directories (UFD)</li>
                <li><strong>Advantages:</strong> Isolates users, allows same file names</li>
                <li><strong>Disadvantages:</strong> No grouping within user, limited organization</li>
              </ul>

              <h5>3. Hierarchical (Tree) Directory</h5>
              <p>Most common structure. Directories can contain files and subdirectories, forming a tree.</p>

              <h4>Mounting Operations:</h4>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Mount:</strong> Attach file system to directory tree</li>
                <li><strong>Unmount:</strong> Detach file system (must not be in use)</li>
                <li><strong>Remount:</strong> Change mount options without unmounting</li>
                <li><strong>Bind Mount:</strong> Create additional mount points for same file system</li>
              </ul>

              <h4>Mount Options:</h4>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Read-Only (ro):</strong> Prevent modifications</li>
                <li><strong>Read-Write (rw):</strong> Allow modifications</li>
                <li><strong>No-Execute (noexec):</strong> Prevent execution of binaries</li>
                <li><strong>No-Suid (nosuid):</strong> Ignore setuid/setgid bits</li>
                <li><strong>Sync/Async:</strong> Synchronous or asynchronous I/O</li>
              </ul>

              <h4>Mounting Benefits:</h4>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Abstraction:</strong> Uniform access to different storage devices</li>
                <li><strong>Flexibility:</strong> Add/remove storage dynamically</li>
                <li><strong>Organization:</strong> Structured access to multiple file systems</li>
                <li><strong>Security:</strong> Control access through mount options</li>
              </ul>

              <h3>File Sharing</h3>
              <p>File sharing allows multiple users or processes to access the same file simultaneously. This requires careful coordination to maintain data consistency and prevent conflicts.</p>

              <h4>File Sharing Models:</h4>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Client-Server:</strong> Centralized file server (NFS, SMB/CIFS)</li>
                <li><strong>Peer-to-Peer:</strong> Distributed file sharing (BitTorrent)</li>
                <li><strong>Hybrid:</strong> Combination of both approaches</li>
                <li><strong>Cloud-Based:</strong> Internet-hosted file sharing (Dropbox, Google Drive)</li>
              </ul>

              <h4>File Sharing Semantics:</h4>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>UNIX Semantics:</strong> Changes immediately visible to all users</li>
                <li><strong>Session Semantics:</strong> Changes visible only when file is closed</li>
                <li><strong>Immutable Shared Files:</strong> Files cannot be modified once shared</li>
                <li><strong>Transaction Semantics:</strong> All-or-nothing atomic operations</li>
              </ul>

              <h3>File Protection</h3>
              <p>File protection mechanisms ensure that only authorized users can access files and that users cannot damage files they do not own. Protection is essential for multi-user systems.</p>

              <h4>Protection Approaches:</h4>

              <h5>1. Access Control Lists (ACLs):</h5>
              <ul>
                <li>List of users and their permissions for each file</li>
                <li>Flexible but can be large for many users</li>
                <li>Example: User1(read,write), User2(read), User3(execute)</li>
              </ul>

              <h5>2. Capability-Based:</h5>
              <ul>
                <li>Tokens granting specific rights to holders</li>
                <li>Capabilities can be passed between processes</li>
                <li>Difficult to revoke capabilities</li>
              </ul>

              <h5>3. Protection Domains:</h5>
              <ul>
                <li>Sets of access rights for processes</li>
                <li>Processes execute within protection domains</li>
                <li>Domain switching for different privileges</li>
              </ul>

              <h5>4. Groups:</h5>
              <ul>
                <li>Users organized into groups</li>
                <li>Permissions assigned to groups</li>
                <li>Simplifies management for many users</li>
              </ul>

              <h4>Access Rights:</h4>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Read (r):</strong> View file contents</li>
                <li><strong>Write (w):</strong> Modify file contents</li>
                <li><strong>Execute (x):</strong> Run file as program</li>
                <li><strong>Delete (d):</strong> Remove file</li>
                <li><strong>Append (a):</strong> Add to end of file only</li>
                <li><strong>List (l):</strong> List directory contents</li>
              </ul>

              <h3>Overview of Mass Storage Structure</h3>
              <p>Mass storage refers to secondary storage devices that provide non-volatile storage for large amounts of data. Understanding the structure and organization of mass storage is crucial for efficient file system design and performance optimization.</p>

              <h4>Storage Hierarchy:</h4>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Cache Memory:</strong> Fastest, smallest (KB-MB), volatile, most expensive</li>
                <li><strong>Main Memory (RAM):</strong> Fast, moderate size (GB), volatile, expensive</li>
                <li><strong>Magnetic Disks (HDD):</strong> Slower, large (TB), non-volatile, moderate cost</li>
                <li><strong>Solid State Drives (SSD):</strong> Fast, large (TB), non-volatile, moderate cost</li>
                <li><strong>Optical Storage:</strong> Slower, moderate (GB), non-volatile, cheap</li>
                <li><strong>Magnetic Tapes:</strong> Slowest, largest (TB-PB), non-volatile, cheapest</li>
              </ul>

              <h4>Mass Storage Characteristics:</h4>

                <li><strong>Cost per Byte:</strong> Economic consideration</li>
              </ul>

              <h3>Disk Structure</h3>
              <p>Magnetic disks (Hard Disk Drives - HDDs) are the most common form of secondary storage. Understanding their physical structure is essential for efficient data access and disk scheduling algorithms.</p>

              <h4>Physical Disk Structure:</h4>
              <div className="example-box">
                <h5>Disk Components</h5>
                <ul>
                  <li><strong>Platters:</strong> Multiple circular disks stacked together (coated with magnetic material)</li>
                  <li><strong>Tracks:</strong> Concentric circles on each platter surface</li>
                  <li><strong>Sectors:</strong> Arc-shaped divisions of tracks (typically 512 bytes or 4KB)</li>
                  <li><strong>Cylinders:</strong> Same track number across all platters (vertical alignment)</li>
                  <li><strong>Read/Write Heads:</strong> Access data on each platter surface (one per surface)</li>
                  <li><strong>Spindle:</strong> Rotates the entire disk assembly (5400-15000 RPM)</li>

              <ul>
                <li><strong>Definition:</strong> Time for desired sector to rotate under head</li>
                <li><strong>Average:</strong> Half rotation time</li>
                <li><strong>Calculation:</strong> (60 seconds / RPM) / 2</li>
                <li><strong>Example:</strong> 7200 RPM → (60/7200)/2 = 4.17 ms</li>
              </ul>

              <h5>3. Transfer Time:</h5>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Definition:</strong> Time to read/write data</li>
                <li><strong>Calculation:</strong> (Bytes to transfer) / (Transfer rate)</li>
                <li><strong>Typical Rate:</strong> 50-200 MB/s for HDDs</li>
              </ul>

              <h5>4. Average Access Time:</h5>
              <p><strong>Formula:</strong> Access Time = Seek Time + Rotational Latency + Transfer Time</p>

              <h3>Disk Scheduling</h3>
              <p>Disk scheduling algorithms determine the order in which disk I/O requests are serviced. The goal is to minimize seek time, maximize throughput, and ensure fairness among requests.</p>

              <h4>Scheduling Goals:</h4>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Minimize Seek Time:</strong> Reduce head movement distance</li>
                <li><strong>Maximize Throughput:</strong> Service more requests per unit time</li>
                <li><strong>Minimize Response Time:</strong> Reduce waiting time for requests</li>
                <li><strong>Minimize Variance:</strong> Provide predictable response times</li>
                <li><strong>Prevent Starvation:</strong> Ensure all requests are eventually served</li>
              </ul>

              <h4>Factors Affecting Scheduling:</h4>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Current Head Position:</strong> Starting location of read/write head</li>
                <li><strong>Request Queue:</strong> Pending I/O requests</li>
                <li><strong>Direction of Movement:</strong> Previous head motion direction</li>
                <li><strong>Request Distribution:</strong> Spatial distribution of requests</li>
              </ul>

              <h3>1. FCFS (First-Come, First-Served)</h3>
              <p>The simplest disk scheduling algorithm. Processes requests in the order they arrive in the queue, without considering their location on the disk.</p>

              <div className="example-box">
                <h5>FCFS Example</h5>
                <p><strong>Initial head position:</strong> 50</p>
                <p><strong>Request queue:</strong> 98, 183, 37, 122, 14, 124, 65, 67</p>
                <p><strong>Disk size:</strong> 0-199 cylinders</p>
                <p><strong>Sequence of access:</strong></p>
                <p>50 → 98 → 183 → 37 → 122 → 14 → 124 → 65 → 67</p>
                <p><strong>Head movements:</strong></p>
                <pre style={{background: '#f5f5f5', padding: '12px', borderRadius: '4px', overflow: 'auto'}}>
{`|50-98| + |98-183| + |183-37| + |37-122| + 
|122-14| + |14-124| + |124-65| + |65-67|
= 48 + 85 + 146 + 85 + 108 + 110 + 59 + 2
= 643 cylinders`}
                </pre>
                <p><strong>Total head movements: 643 cylinders</strong></p>
              </div>

              <h4>FCFS Advantages:</h4>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Fairness:</strong> First-come, first-served basis</li>
                <li><strong>Simplicity:</strong> Easy to implement (just a queue)</li>
                <li><strong>No Starvation:</strong> All requests eventually served</li>
                <li><strong>Predictability:</strong> Deterministic behavior</li>
              </ul>

              <h4>FCFS Disadvantages:</h4>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Poor Performance:</strong> Does not optimize seek time</li>
                <li><strong>Convoy Effect:</strong> Short requests wait behind long ones</li>
                <li><strong>High Average Time:</strong> Suboptimal for many requests</li>
                <li><strong>No Optimization:</strong> Ignores physical disk layout</li>
                <li><strong>Wild Swings:</strong> Head may move back and forth across disk</li>
              </ul>

              <h3>2. SSTF (Shortest Seek Time First)</h3>
              <p>Greedy algorithm that selects the request requiring minimum seek time from the current head position. Always chooses the closest request to service next.</p>

              <div className="example-box">
                <h5>SSTF Example</h5>
                <p><strong>Initial head position:</strong> 50</p>
                <p><strong>Request queue:</strong> 98, 183, 37, 122, 14, 124, 65, 67</p>
                <p><strong>Step-by-step selection:</strong></p>
                <pre style={{background: '#f5f5f5', padding: '12px', borderRadius: '4px', overflow: 'auto', fontSize: '0.85rem'}}>
{`Current: 50 → Closest: 65 (distance 15)
Current: 65 → Closest: 67 (distance 2)
Current: 67 → Closest: 37 (distance 30)
Current: 37 → Closest: 14 (distance 23)
Current: 14 → Closest: 98 (distance 84)
Current: 98 → Closest: 122 (distance 24)
Current: 122 → Closest: 124 (distance 2)
Current: 124 → Closest: 183 (distance 59)`}
                </pre>
                <p><strong>Sequence:</strong> 50 → 65 → 67 → 37 → 14 → 98 → 122 → 124 → 183</p>
                <p><strong>Head movements:</strong> 15 + 2 + 30 + 23 + 84 + 24 + 2 + 59 = 239 cylinders</p>
                <p><strong>Total: 239 cylinders (63% better than FCFS!)</strong></p>
              </div>

              <h4>SSTF Advantages:</h4>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Better Performance:</strong> Significantly better than FCFS</li>
                <li><strong>Greedy Approach:</strong> Locally optimal choices</li>
                <li><strong>Reduced Average Time:</strong> Lower average seek time</li>
                <li><strong>Simple Logic:</strong> Easy to understand</li>
              </ul>

              <h4>SSTF Disadvantages:</h4>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Potential Starvation:</strong> Requests far from head may wait indefinitely</li>
                <li><strong>Not Globally Optimal:</strong> Greedy may not be best overall</li>
                <li><strong>Direction Changes:</strong> Head may move back and forth</li>
                <li><strong>Unfairness:</strong> Some requests wait much longer</li>
              </ul>

              <h3>3. SCAN (Elevator Algorithm)</h3>
              <p>The disk arm moves in one direction, servicing all requests until it reaches the end of the disk, then reverses direction and repeats. Similar to an elevator moving up and down.</p>

              <div className="example-box">
                <h5>SCAN Example</h5>
                <p><strong>Initial head position:</strong> 50, moving toward larger cylinders</p>
                <p><strong>Request queue:</strong> 98, 183, 37, 122, 14, 124, 65, 67</p>
                <p><strong>Disk size:</strong> 0-199</p>
                <p><strong>Sorted requests in scan direction (→):</strong> 65, 67, 98, 122, 124, 183</p>
                <p><strong>Sorted requests in reverse direction (←):</strong> 37, 14</p>
                <p><strong>Sequence:</strong></p>
                <p>50 → 65 → 67 → 98 → 122 → 124 → 183 → 199 (end) → 37 → 14</p>
                <p><strong>Head movements:</strong></p>
                <pre style={{background: '#f5f5f5', padding: '12px', borderRadius: '4px', overflow: 'auto'}}>

                </pre>
                <p><strong>Total: 334 cylinders</strong></p>
              </div>

              <h4>SCAN Advantages:</h4>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Better Performance:</strong> Better than FCFS</li>
                <li><strong>No Starvation:</strong> All requests eventually served</li>
                <li><strong>Stable Performance:</strong> Consistent behavior</li>
                <li><strong>Fairness:</strong> More fair than SSTF</li>
              </ul>

              <h4>SCAN Disadvantages:</h4>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Midpoint Preference:</strong> Requests near middle serviced more frequently</li>
                <li><strong>End-to-End Travel:</strong> May move to extreme positions unnecessarily</li>
                <li><strong>Unequal Waiting:</strong> Some requests wait longer</li>
                <li><strong>Direction Dependency:</strong> Performance varies by initial direction</li>
              </ul>

              <h3>4. CSCAN (Circular SCAN)</h3>
              <p>Moves the disk arm in one direction, servicing requests until it reaches the end, then immediately returns to the beginning without servicing requests on the return trip. Provides more uniform wait times.</p>

              <div className="example-box">
                <h5>CSCAN Example</h5>

                <li><strong>Less Optimal:</strong> May not be as efficient as SCAN</li>
                <li><strong>Directional Bias:</strong> Always moves in same logical direction</li>
                <li><strong>Wasted Movement:</strong> Return trip services no requests</li>

                <li><strong>Implementation:</strong> FCFS simplest, others more complex</li>
                <li><strong>Workload:</strong> Choice depends on request patterns</li>
              </ul>

              <h4>Modern Considerations:</h4>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>SSD Storage:</strong> No mechanical movement, different scheduling needs</li>
                <li><strong>RAID Arrays:</strong> Multiple disk coordination required</li>
                <li><strong>NCQ (Native Command Queuing):</strong> Hardware-level optimization</li>
                <li><strong>TRIM Command:</strong> For SSD wear leveling and performance</li>
                <li><strong>I/O Schedulers:</strong> Linux uses CFQ, Deadline, or NOOP</li>
              </ul>

                <h5>Real-World Application</h5>
                <p>Modern operating systems often use variations or combinations:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li><strong>Linux:</strong> CFQ (Completely Fair Queuing), Deadline scheduler</li>
                  <li><strong>Windows:</strong> Anticipatory scheduling</li>
                  <li><strong>SSDs:</strong> Simple FIFO or NOOP (no optimization needed)</li>
                  <li><strong>Enterprise:</strong> Often use SCAN variants for fairness</li>
                </ul>
